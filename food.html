            <h2>History of Food in Tokyo</h2>
            <p>In the 9th century, grilled fish and sliced raw fish were widely popular. Japanese people who could afford it would eat fish at every meal; others would have to make do without animal protein for many of their meals. In traditional Japanese cuisine, oil and fat are usually avoided within the cooking process, because Japanese people were trying to keep a healthy lifestyle. </p>
            <q>If I were trapped in one city and had to eat only one nation's cuisine for the rest of my life, I would not mind eating japanese. I adore Japanese food. I love it. -Anothony Bourdain</q>
